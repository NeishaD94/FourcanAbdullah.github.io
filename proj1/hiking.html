    <p><i>Glaciers</i> Experience is a small group experience
      that offers an easy glacier hike on Sólheimajökull glacier

    <p>Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty
      Mýrdalsjökull and is surrounded by some of Iceland’s most
      grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms
      in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the location.
       This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact
       with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!
